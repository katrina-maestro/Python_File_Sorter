# Python_File_Sorter
The Automated File Sorter is a Python script that organizes files in a specified directory by categorizing them into folders based on their file extensions (.xlsx, .png, .pdf, .txt). It automatically creates folders, sorts files into the appropriate directories, and handles unsupported extensions with error messages.
